    <p class="story">In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate
      the visual form
      of a
      document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is
      available,
      but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to
      consider
      form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

      Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a first-century BC text by the
      Roman
      statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.

      Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized
      by
      advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when
      Aldus
      employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular
      word
      processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted Lorem ipsum as well.

      Of course, with tens of thousands of wineries around the world, we'll need to narrow down our list of candidates
      if we expect to find the best.
      Luckily for us, we have data on ~16,700 of the world's most popular (where we conveniently assume popular entails
      being reviewed by winemag), including wine points. The points system indicates the quality of wine
      for a given wine.. As an easy first-filter of quality, we'll limit our set of potential wineries to those
      with a median points score greater-than-or-equal-to 95 (where the overall median = 88). (We use the median
      to remove any pulling effect from high-quality wines at an otherwise mediocre winery). This limits our
      data to the following winery count per country:

    <h2>What Makes A Winery The 'Best'?</h2>
    <p class="story">
      A quality winery is more than just the aggregate of its wine points - otherwise
      we'd just filter for the max and call it a day. No, a quality winery may be comprised from
      a number of factors:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Points</b>: How much reviewers enjoy the wine</li>
      <li><b>Price</b>: How much reviewers enjoy the wine</li>
      <li><b>Quality</b>:How much reviewers enjoy the wine</li>
      <li><b>Selection</b>:How much reviewers enjoy the wine</li>
      <li><b>Value</b>:How much reviewers enjoy the wine</li>
